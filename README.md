This code snippet encapsulates the essence of a basic calculator through a concise and elegant implementation. The program's user-centric approach thrives in presenting users with a menu of mathematical operations, enabling them to input operands and swiftly receive accurate results.
This C program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It presents users with a menu to choose from four different operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. After selecting an operation, users input two numbers on which the chosen operation will be performed. The program then uses a `switch` statement to execute the selected operation and displays the result. If the user provides an invalid choice, the program informs them by printing "Invalid Choice." This code snippet serves as a basic foundation for a calculator program, and it showcases how to take user input, perform calculations, and present results in a clear and concise manner.
